Let me take the aggressive model as example to explain these training results.

Aggressive_1-5 represents the 5-fold cross-validation of the aggressive model.

Aggressive_1 contains the training result of the models, Aggressive_1_results contains the loss and accuracy of the models. Aggressive_1_specials contains the best/worst/median/average individuals of the models.


For the details:

One example of Aggressive_1:
41.3718  78 001100000100101100101110000111010000001100011010100010110010010001100000101000
It represents the total loss , gene length, detailed gene.

One example of Aggressive_1_results:
10 1664 0.994026284348865 10 0.005973715651135006 
It represents the total loss, number of loss=0 action, percent of loss=0 action, number of loss=1 action, percent of loss=1 action.
