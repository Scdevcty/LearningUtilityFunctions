We have 4 designed behaviors to train:

TOVOR_20:
Training data for aggressive model, if we can't hit oppenent with punch, we keep moving forward to get close to it, when we get close enough we use punch.

TOVOR_60:
Training data for Defensive model, if we will be hit by oppenent right away, we use guard, if not, we use step back to keep away from oppenent.

TOVOR_78:
Training data for Hybrid 1(old) model, we use aggressive behavior at first, and if our HP is some lower than oppenent, we then use defensive behavior.

TOVOR_100:
Training data for Hybrid 2(new) model, we use defensive behavior at first, and if our HP is some lower than oppenent, we then use aggressive behavior.
